looks
fool you there's more to this noble
breed than what meets the eye
basset hounds are excellent tracking
dogs running after any scent that comes
their way but they're just as happy to
spend
all their time relaxing with you and
guess what they have made it to the tv
industry as well
find out all about these dogs as we
start a list of top 10 interesting facts
about the basset hound but before we
start our list we'd like to take a
moment to express
our thanks to all the original basset
owners on this video
the video would seriously not have been
possible without them so don't forget to
check out these adorable hounds from
their instagram profiles that have been
linked in the description below
now let's begin the list number one
their origin
and history the basset hound has long
been favorite breed for hunting small
animals but it's widely believed that
their existence
is a fluke these dogs are believed to be
descendants of the famed saint hubert
hounds
and resulted when a gene mutation
produced a dwarf town perhaps the dwarf
hounds were kept as curiosities and
later bred on purpose with their ability
to track rabbits and air in thick
forests was observed
the first recorded mention of a passat
hound was in an illustrated book about
hunting lavenori
written by jacques de fuliu in 1585.
from the illustrations

it appears that the early french basset
hounds resembled the present-day basset
artisan normand a dog breed today known
in france soon enough the breed became
popular with french aristocrats who
spent many hours on trail hunting with their bassets
and after the french revolution basset
hounds became more common around the
world the breed most likely came to
america by way of england and colonial
times and was recognized by the american
kennel club
as its 10th breed in 1885.
number two their physical appearance
basset downs stand no higher than 14
inches at the shoulder but with their
remarkably heavy bones
powerful little legs and massive paws
they possess strength and stamina
just like any other big dog they're
famous for their large domed heads that
feature extremely long
velvety ears mournful eyes and a
wrinkled brow
giving the breed the look of a sad clam
their body is long and with their
short legs bassets look like they are
rectangular in shape but even with their
short legs
these hands truly are big dogs weighing
anywhere in between 50 to 65 pounds
while talking about their coat they have
a nice short tight coat
with no long hair on legs or tail the
most commonly seen colors are tri-color
or red and white
but any hound color is acceptable also
since bassets are bulky
you must know that they are slow to
mature and won't reach their full size
until they're 2 years old

number three their personality and
temperament around the house basset
hounds are calm and rather
lazy on their own but they make
wonderful family dogs as they get along
well with
just about everybody children adults
dogs and even other animals
having developed as pack animals acid
hounds always feel a need for company
and are the happiest when they have
their families around they really hate
to be left alone for a long period of
time and so you may find your best at
howling and becoming destructive if you
leave them unattended for too long
if you're planning to get one of these
dogs we recommend that you get two of
them instead so that even when you're
not home
they'll have each other's company basset
hounds can sometimes be stubborn too if
they don't want to comply but it is rare
for the breed to have temperament issues

number four they have a very strong
sense of smell
coming in a close second to the
bloodhound facets are known for their
incredible sense of smell in fact
they have over 220 million smell
receptors and the portion of their brain
responsible for the sense of smell is
way better than that of any other dax
they can even take in a huge range of
smells
and isolate just one to follow this is
why basset hounds consistently perform
so well in scent work and tracking
there's even a whole competition called
basset hound field trails
organized by the american kennel club
based on their impeccable ability to
track scents and hunt
number five their floppy ears sure
bassett hounds long floppy ears add to
the breed's charm but these ears are not
just for sure
their long ears help to stir smells up
toward the nose and the droopy skin on
the face holds the smell closed for the
maximum of factory impact
their short legs also keep them close to
the ground and closer to the scents they
are tracking
this is part of the reason why these
ducks can take in a big range of smells
simultaneously they prefer to
investigate slowly
and love to make work of their own nose
and ears as they sniff and trail
these are talented and determined
trackers not easily dissuaded from their
course
number six they have a unique voice
basset hounds are considered one of the
most melodious dog breeds around
their barking is labeled as baying and
this is not the typical woof woof you
hear from most dogs
bing is the sound dogs from the hound
group like basset hounds make
when they're in packs or hunting it's a
low persistent bark that becomes
stronger as the duck closes in on their
targets to alert other dogs and hunters
that it's time to round up
assets are also specially vocal when
they're left to their own devices
and this is when they help a howl is a
long drawn out bark
some say the sound is sorrowful and
forlorn you'll definitely know what's
going on with your basset if you learn
to recognize their sounds
number seven training them is important
but difficult
over the centuries sent outs of this
type were developed to hunt on their own
and to follow a track without
distraction this has made them very
alert and independent beings with a
highly stubborn streak so don't be
surprised if you find your basset aloof
and is interested in following any of
your commands
this is exactly why you gotta train
these guys from an early age early
socialization classes and obedience
training is a must for these dogs police
training is also equally important
because if they pick up a scent they'll
most likely wander off without giving
any second thought their stubbornness
does make training them
very difficult though it takes a lot of
time consistency and persistence from
your side
also these dogs are emotionally
sensitive and will shut down immediately
if treated roughly so make sure you only
use
gentle and positive training methods
with these guys
number eight they are prone to obesity
basset hounds are hearty eaters and they
are not very active in the house
this is why they can gain weight quickly
and can become obese in no time
obesity in turn can also result in back
and leg problems
so it's also important to properly
portion your basted hounds food
you gotta portion out food relative to
your bastard's condition and not by the
recommendation
on the bag or can if you're unsure it's
best that you talk to your vet about the
best diet for your diet
you can also keep an exercise scheduled
for at least one long walk per day
to keep your basset fit and healthy
number nine the grooming requirements it
takes a lot of time and effort to groom
these hands you gotta keep wiping up the
drool they left behind
all the time because they drool a lot
their ears are long in drag on the
ground and can get dirty
very fast those lustrous ears also don't
circulate air very well
and this can lead to infections so you
got to clean their ears at least
once a week their eyes too need frequent
wiping to prevent infection
additionally as a result of being so low
to the ground bassets pick up more dirt
than other dogs which means they need
frequent bats basset hounds also shed
all year round but if you brush them
quickly
shedding should not be a problem the
rest is basic care make sure you brush
their teeth daily with a wet approved
toothpaste and trim their nails once
or twice a month number 10 they are part
of the show business
only a few other breeds have enjoyed the
media exposure that the basset hound has
way back on 27th of february 1928
time magazine featured a basset on its
front cover to promote a story in the
celebrated westminster kennel club doc
show
at madison square garden there are also
several television shows
both animated and live accent which have
basset hounds as one of the main
characters
a great example from classic television
is flash from the dukes of hazzard flash
was sheriff rosca coltrane's duck
like the stereotypical basset hound
flash laced around a lot
and rarely moved if there was no food
involved a more modern example of a
basset hound
is doris from the middle although doris
only appears in just a few episodes
sporadically throughout the series
she's a unique and memorable character
of the show facets have also been
popular in advertising campaigns
the logo for hush puppies brand shoes

many decades and to this day a number of
people refer to the breed as the hush
puppies
