Thank you. Thank you organizers, give the organizers a round of applause right now! you ungrateful b**stards. 

Organizing F8cking sucks.  Organizing a group of people bigger than one sucks. 

Even something as simple as dinner. Just dinner, where do you want to go eat? where do you want to go eat? I'm okay with anything, where do you want to? 
Oh no, I'm completely okay with anything, it's completely up to you, you decide, no, no, no, it's fine. 
It's completely up to you, I'm okay with anything,  I am easy. 
where do you want to go? 

[acting&gesture] it becomes this fucking battle to see who can care less about the decision you're about to make. 
I'm so sick of "'I'm okay with anything, I'm okay with anything". I'm okay, I'm okay with anything, That's my contribution to the evening. Oh, oh man, that was hard work, 
I'm okay with anything. It's up to you guys now, I"m okay, I'm okay with anything. I'm out. 

I contributed to the decision making, I"m ok with anything.   

I'm ok with anything?! Why do you have to do to aim so low in life? I"m okay with anything. I'll be okay with anything.   
Okay, well, what will['wha-dll] you be good with? what will you be good with?, 
why don't you tell me what you'll be good with? why you have to be okay. I'm okay with anything. 


Anything?  Anything?!!!

You're okay with anything? Diarrhea?  you're okay with diarrhea?
No, No diarrhoea, okay, Genocide? are you okay with genocide?
No? so that's two things that you're not okay with right there!
Let's put some parameters on this decision making right now!

These days, more and more people complaining about technology on the internet, 
They use the internet to complain about technology. 

like newsFeel on my FB(twitter), one thing that people complains the most has been the iphone,

Oh my god~!!  the iphone is destroying `human beings` ability to `interact socially.`
We've never been more connected and more alone, 
the iPhone is destroying `human beings` ability to form emotional connections with each other.  

Have you seen us/this on the train? 
All we do is look at our screens. We don't talk to each other anymore. 
We don't try to have a conversation. We just look at our screens, we don't form emotional connections with other people. 
We're too busy looking at our screens. 

Yeah,that's right, you dumb fuck, because before the iPhone I used to form emotional connections `with everybody on public transport.` 
Oh, Oh, before the iPhone I `used to turn to` the woman on my right, right? I form an emotional meaningful connection with her, right, 
and I turned to the guy on my left, we bond over our hopes and dreams for the new year......... 
and our shared optimism for the future. 
Oh, The train was just so full of love.  It was `a utopia` on earth,    

before the iPhone came, and just destroyed everything. ohhhhh. no,  iphone destroys everything...
Listen !if you're forming emotional connection with everybody on the train, you're the crazy person on the train(in the bar).

`Are you kidding me?` when I've lived in NY, the iphone 's ability to capture video 
and sound is like `the only thing` keeping me from being racially abused on public transport. 

Dude, enough! Every NY day, I'm just walking to the train. 
I just stop and hit record, Let's go, right, who wants to be a Youtube sensation today? 
Let's go, call me chink, call me a chink. 
I need the view, call me a chink!!  
Sorry, that got a little dark, I'm sorry. 
(sorry, I am just kidding!  I'm sorry)
