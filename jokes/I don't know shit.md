ISMO | I Didn't Know Sh*t ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©
```
There are so many difficult words, and I think the hardest word, in America, has been the word, "Shit."
I thought it's easy... that I know what "shit" means, but it turns out, I didn't know shit!
I think it's `the most` complicated word. Like, how could it be, if something is bad, it's shit?
If something is really good, it's THE shit.

I would have never guessed that!
I-- I had to study that shit.

So important, `the article.` Like-- like if-- if I-- if I give shit,
If I give shit, to you that means that, uh, that I'm telling you off, 
but if I give A shit, Well, then I care!

And if I take shit-- if I take shit, then I accept that you are bullying me,
but if I take A shit...
I-- I take a shit. (go to poop)

And I learned that my shit is always good and positive, but you're shit, his shit, her shit - always bad.
Like, "I can't deal with her shit; I have to `put up with` his shit; Clean up your shit;
But don't touch my shit!"


And-- and then I learned that, uh, that if somebody says I have shit to do,
it can refer to any activity,
whatsoever.
Any! Except one...
Actually shitting.

Nobody says that, when they're going to the bathroom.
Nobody, except me.
I love to do that. I-- I-- I love doing it.
"Uh, I have to go. I have shit to do."
"Uh, what are you going to do?"
"I have already told you."

Then I learned that the phrase, "AND shit,"
doesn't mean anything.
If somebody says, "and shit," it'--
it's nothing.
It's just something that you say, to make your list sound longer.
Like if somebody says, "Oh, I like to travel, and shit,"
you have to know that they ONLY like to travel.

And to make it even more complicated, shit can be divided into a piece of shit.
And that has a completely different meaning.
A piece of shit is a bad movie, a lousy car, or a person who is being selfish.
And the piece of shit can get bigger and bigger,
but it can never be the WHOLE shit.
Like-- like, if I'm a piece of shit, I'm being selfish,
and if I'm a GIANT piece of shit, I'm even more selfish!

But if I'm THE shit, I'm great!
