15 Early Game Tips & Secrets - Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

Tears of the Kingdom is finally out, and it’s massive: it’s another adventure through
the vast world of Breath of the Wild, but the Kingdom of Hyrule has changed, and expanded,
significantly between the games.
The sheer scale of this game world and the amount of secrets and mechanics crammed into
it can be pretty overwhelming at the start, so I’ve compiled some tips to guide you
through the early stages of Tears of the Kingdom, as well as some little secrets and details
that I found interesting.
This video won’t contain any big story spoilers, but it does assume that you have started playing
the game and exploring its world, and will naturally cover some locations and game mechanics
that you won’t encounter until you leave the Great Sky Island and begin your adventure
on the surface, and below it.
So, don’t worry about this video spoiling the game’s story, but if you’d rather
play this game completely blind then I’d advise skipping this one.
Recall Uses
Recall is the final ability Link unlocks on the Great Sky Island - the power to rewind
time for certain objects, and send them back where they came from.
Obviously, this is incredibly useful in situations like sending projectiles back at enemies and
lifting chunks of fallen islands back into the sky, but Recall is unbelievably powerful
and can be used in so many different, useful ways.
If you’ve spent hours building an ultimate Zonai contraption only to see it fall off
the edge of an island or into a Shrine’s bottomless pit, just use Recall: the act of
just selecting the ability pauses time, and the ability itself has a very long range:
meaning you can use it to recover something you’ve lost in most situations.
Recall can also be used to reverse you moving an object with Ultrahand.
If you need to use a Wing to glide through the air, but don’t have any carts to attach
to it or rails to place it on, instead try positioning the Wing somewhere in the air,
then bringing it down to your feet.
If we climb on and use Recall on the Wing, it will rewind the Ultrahand movement and
lift the device into the air - from where we’re able to glide freely.
Using Recall on Ultrahand movements really opens up an entire new world of possibilities
using this ability - I’m sure what I’ve discovered with it so far is only scratching
the surface.
Breath of the Wild Horses
Just like Breath of the Wild, one of the most efficient ways to get around the surface of
Hyrule in this game is on horseback.
Horses can be tamed by mounting them and having enough stamina to hold on while they are tamed,
and can then be stored at Stables: allowing Link to access his horses from any Stable
he finds across the world.
If the Switch you’re playing Tears of the Kingdom on has save data for Breath of the
Wild, then your registered horses carry over into the sequel: simply attempt to register
a new horse at a Stable - even if you don’t have one to register - to trigger the dialogue,
and you’ll be able to see your old friends in this new game.
Glider Scope
Once you obtain the Purah Pad on the Great Sky Island, you’re able to use it like Breath
of the Wild’s Sheikah Slate as a map, travel log, and as a telescope.
Notably, in this game, you’re able to open the Purah Pad’s Scope even while in the
air - which is very useful for creating Map Pins from high above the Surface.
Fuse Menu
The Fuse Material Slider accessed by pressing Up on the D-Pad can be sorted differently
by pressing Y: including by Fuse Attack Power and by Most Used.
This menu can also be used to drop materials to Fuse with, and even to throw materials,
by holding R to ready a throw, then holding up on the D-Pad.
Fuse for Warmth
At various points, Link is required to traverse freezing environments - where, without special
clothing to keep him warm, he’ll take damage from the cold.
This can of course be prevented by cooking meals with the Cold Resistance effect, which
keeps Link warm until the timer runs out, but the same effect can also be achieved by
carrying different equipment.
Carrying a lit torch will keep Link warm, but this isn’t very practical - instead,
it’s possible to Fuse a Ruby to a weapon or a shield to create an item that, while
on Link’s back, will keep him from freezing.
Rubies are relatively rare and expensive, and can be used to create very powerful fire
arrows, so it might be worth saving them - but a weapon or shield Fused with one won’t
lose any durability while doing its job keeping Link warm, only when it’s actually used,
so it’s possible to always keep the same Ruby-Fused item in your Inventory to tackle
the cold until you find some warmer clothing.
Link Humming
Cooking is just as essential in Tears of the Kingdom as it was in Breath of the Wild - allowing
him to combine ingredients to make meals that will prepare him for whatever he’s faced with.
Cooking up a meal plays the same jingle as in the previous game, but in Tears of the
Kingdom, Link hums older Zelda songs as he cooks!
Cookbook
Cooking hasn’t only been improved with adorable humming, though.
Tears of the Kingdom includes a cookbook, allowing you to easily log and scroll through
a list of meals you’ve already cooked, including the ingredients used to make it.
To access the cookbook, select any meal you currently have in your Meals Inventory Tab,
then press X to see its recipe, opening the list of every meal that has been logged here.
This is a feature that was sorely missing from Breath of the Wild, and it’s great to see it added here.
Follow the Birds
In Breath of the Wild, flocks of birds often circle above Sheikah Shrines -
giving the player a clue to their location even from a distance.
This doesn’t seem to always be the case in Tears of the Kingdom: but flocks of birds are still worth noticing.
They seem to circle over various different points of interest: I’ve found birds flying above Shrines,
above overworld bosses, like Hinoxes, but they also seem to hover particularly often above Chasms.
As well as smaller caves, the Upheaval also caused these giant chasms to open up in the ground,
each surrounded by a menacing aura of gloom.
Most can be spotted from the sky above, making them easy to scout out,
but others can be hidden in caves or wells, obscured from above.
I’ve found multiple chasms by searching below flocks of birds - but, even if they don’t lead to a Chasm, they’re definitely worth following.
Lightroots
At the bottom of the chasms are The Depths: a dark world underneath the Kingdom: a map just as
large as the Surface above it, shrouded in a perpetual pitch darkness.
To illuminate areas of the Depths, Link needs to find Lightroots - strange plants with a
Zonai symbol that glow brightly when activated, as well as function as fast travel points.
It can be difficult to find Lightroots down here in the darkness, but there’s a trick.
Each Lightroot is found directly underneath a Shrine on the Surface - almost as if both
of them, the Shrine and the Lightroot, are part of the same, mysterious Zonai structure.
In fact, the names of the Lightroots are just the names of the Shrines above them spelled
backwards - fitting for the same location in this mirrored, nightmarish version of Hyrule.
This makes it possible to use the locations of Shrines and Lightroots to find each other.
If you’re in the Depths, but have previously discovered a Shrine nearby up on the Surface,
then you know there will be a Lightroot found at that location in the Depths.
And vice versa - if you discover a Lightroot, you’ll know that there will be a Shrine
found just above it: which makes discovering some of the more hidden ones easier.
Zonaite
The Depths are by far the best place to find Zonaite, the material harnessed to power Zonai
technology.
Exploring the Depths and progressing through the sidequests you find there will reward
Link with a lot of Zonaite, which can then be processed by Forge Constructs into Crystallised
Charges at a rate of 3 to 1.
100 Crystallised Charges can be traded in at a Crystal Refinery for an extra Energy
Cell on Link’s hip, allowing him to power nearby Zonai Devices for longer.
You will occasionally find Large Zonaite, too - which can be traded in at Forge Constructs
for Large Crystallised Charges, each counting for 20 regular ones.
Both a Forge Construct and a Crystal Refinery can be found on the Great Sky Island, but
additional ones are found in Hyrule and the Depths, too.
Energy Cells
Link’s battery meter can be replenished by using Zonai Charges, or, if it’s already
full, increase it with temporary yellow battery meters, allowing him to use Zonai technology
for far longer than he should be able to at that point.
Large Zonai Charges are even more useful in this regard - they supercharge your Energy
Cell, preventing it from depleting for a short while.
Though both regular and large Zonai Charges are useful to gather Capsules from Dispensers,
it’s worth saving a few to use in times of need to give your vehicles a little extra juice.
Rockets
Zonai Rockets are among the most useful pieces for vehicle building - giving anything they’re
strapped to a massive boost before expiring.
But they’re perhaps at their most useful when Fused to Link’s equipment.
Not only does Fusing a Rocket to Link’s shield launch him into the sky, but Fusing
Rockets to arrows causes them to travel very quickly and in a perfectly straight line,
which can be very useful in situations where long range sniping is necessary.
Rockets can be reliably obtained from a couple of the Zonai Dispenser machines found on Sky
Islands, like this one in the South Hyrule Sky Archipelago.
Dispensers
These Dispensers activate when Link drops Zonai Charges into the hopper, giving out
more Capsules the more Charges added at one time.
It’s also possible to add Large Zonai Charges to Dispensers, which yield much more Capsules
than the smaller versions.
Adding almost anything else to a Dispenser causes it to passively aggressively spit them
back out, but you are able to deposit Zonai Construct Horns in return for Capsules.
You’ll only ever get one Capsule back per horn, no matter the level of the horn, so
it’s best to use Construct I horns rather than anything better.
Bubbul Frogs
The many caves that opened up due to the Upheaval are often filled with treasure and infested
with monsters, but each is also home to a Bubbul Frog: a mysterious creature that appears
to be connected to Satori, the Lord of the Mountain.
When defeated, each Bubbul Frog leaves behind a Bubbul Gem - a collectible item that can
be traded into a strange individual encountered near the Woodland Stable.
Every cave on Hyrule’s surface houses a Bubble Frog - once Link has collected the
Bubble Gem from a cave, the cave’s map icon is marked with a tick to show this.
The Upheaval revealed a lot of caves, though, so it can be hard to make sure you’ve found
all of them.
To make this easier, finding a Cherry Blossom Tree and offering fruit to the altar will
magically highlight every cave in the surrounding area, making hunting Bubble Frogs a lot easier.

the Kingdom content.
I am absolutely loving this game - it’s Breath of the Wild and so much more.
In terms of content on this channel, I want to stay away from heavily story spoilers until
people have had a chance to fully enjoy this experience, so expect smaller videos on the
channel for a few weeks until we can get our teeth into some theories and lore videos.
Cheers guys, and I’ll see you next time.
