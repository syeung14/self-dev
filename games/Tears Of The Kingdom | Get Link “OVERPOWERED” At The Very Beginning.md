https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9onugJcq7s

you want a beefy link as soon as possible I get you  
in tears of the Kingdom's starting areas there are some important `pieces of gear` that  
you shouldn't `miss out on` and some mechanics you can unlock early if you know where to find them.
so I'm gonna quickly show you how to find some better armor stronger weapons a horse maybe even  
a super rare one, expand your inventory and find a great fairy fountain to upgrade your stuff,

I'm Alex and let's get into it, by the way, if you want more tears of the Kingdom, hit subscribe,
because I have some other gameplay breakdowns already `in the works` they're juicy, I promise

Early Cold Resist Gear
alright, at the very beginning, you'll be tasked with seeking out three shrines on great sky  
island and we're going to be shortcutting up to this one first to get an easy permanent solution  
for the cold weather areas, head over to this spot slightly East, and you'll find a cooking  
pot and some spicy peppers nearby, don't worry about trying any weird recipe combos, just toss
`a handful of` five peppers in there, and you'll get a 12 minute 30 second cold resist buff,
then we're going to be taking this back route up to that shrine, `climb up` the snowy path, right by
that cooking pot, `hang a right` which will lead you to this guy. they will give you the energy  
cell used to power devices, get on the speedboat,  hit the fan, and get yourself across the icy water,
immediately take a left, up these steps, then climb up to the next level up, around this waterfall
across this bridge until you reach this spot, all of these walls are going to be icy, so you can't  
climb up them, but if you check over right here, you'll find a `strip of rock` that you can climb,
slowly make your way up that, and you just found a `back door` that leads right to that shrine,
enter and finish that Shrine and you'll get the Ascend ability and after you exit, check  
out this part of a tree `sticking out` nearby, Ascend through that and you'll find up there  
a chest which gives you a pair of fuzzy pants that will provide resistance to the cold here.
now complete the rest of the great Sky Island area at your own pace and `soak it`
all in, it's one big tutorial area that's better designed than many entire games  

Find The Fierce Deity Boots

when you eventually leave gray sky island  and descend onto the surface of Hyrule, follow  
the main quest North to the town of Lookout Landing, complete that main quest line which  
will unlock this Tower, and `the paraglider`  which `we will be needing for` this next step  [para- alongside of]
from town, heads Southwest to the ancient tree stump, across this long bridge, you'll see a large  
area inside the tree that you can explore, while you're down there, take some time to mine any rocks
you see, hopefully, you'll find something like a ruby, because we will need a little bit of money.
at the bottom of that tree you'll find these vines that you need to cut with a sharp weapon and then  
you'll need to make your way up from here, when you reach the top, you'll find this hidden chest  
which gives you the `fierce deity boots` which are a reference to Zelda Majora's Mask, you don't need  
your cold resist pants right now, so `swap over to` these, which gives you three defense and one  
level of the attack up buff, that's a little extra defense and damage Improvement for you  

Find The Barbarian Armor

next from Lookout Landing which you can fast travel to now by the way, we're gonna head to  
this cave to the Northeast, get to the river then  paraglide and swim across then head through these  
hollowed out trees and up to this cave entrance, in the center of this area there will be a stone  
Talus mini boss, so head around to the left or  right side to avoid it, and mine some rocks as  
you go on the back side of that cave you'll see  this cluster of rocks on the wall, and you can  
either throw a weapon with a rock attached or you  can use a bomb with your bow to clear those out.
in there you'll find another hidden chest which  will give you the Barbarian armor which provides  
three defense and another attack up effect giving you level two of that damage buff,
this is optional but if you really want to take on that stone Talus at this point physically  
climb up it and destroy the rock on its back or you can try shooting it with bomb arrows  
when killed or whatever happens to these things it'll drop a strong material you can attach to  
either your weapon or your shield now head back to  Lookout Landing and go to the vendor selling armor  

Get The Hylian Hood
we're going to be buying the headpiece so you'll  need 70 rupees you should be able to sell some  
of the things you've mined like luminous rocks or  a ruby to get enough grab the Hylian hood and now  
you're fully clothed with nine Total Defense and  attack up level two more defense more damage good  
Get A Horse & Towing Harness
next part you're gonna need a horse so try this  area if you haven't already spotted some already  
sneak up and mount one and many in this area  don't even need to be calmed down to ride  
then take your new shiny horse up to this stable  in the northwest I'm using a different stable  
in this footage but go to the one Northwest of  Lookout Landing register that horse by talking  
to the guy at the counter which will give you  a pony points card then if you happen to have  
breath of the wild save data on your system  board that horse at the stable which allows you  
to then take out any breath of the wild horses  that you saved at the Stables from that game  
this could get you a much higher tier horse than  you could possibly find near the starting area  
now still at that same stable that you're at  walk inside and talk to the vendor to sleep there  
that should give you enough Pony points to unlock  the towing harness from The Stables catalog  
this allows you to stick things onto the  back of your horse which we will be putting  
to use for combat purposes from that stable  head really close by Northwest despite your  
Find Hestu
favorite broccoli guy who will give you a quest  to kill some trees yeah kinda like tree mimics  
you can try fire ore and acts like  weapon to kill these pretty quick  
after that you'll complete the quest and you can  use your little korok seed poops to unlock two  
inventory expansions from this location I feel  like having two more weapon slots is the way  
to go up to you then we're gonna take our Towing  horse to this spot east of Lookout Landing near  
Laser Guns?
this Pond you'll have to kill a few enemies and  then you'll find a device that shoots laser beams  
there might be one or two there so attach those  to your horse we're gonna use them as guns we are  
unlike fusing one of these to a weapon or Shield  which will quickly break them you can indefinitely  
use these just on their own which only consumes  your battery energy which comes back over time  
you'll find it's a lot easier to aim these things  if you use your Ultra hand ability to pick them up  
combine multiples of these to increase the  damage at the cost of faster energy drain  
now you can haul these things around the  map and death star blast entire outposts  
with your makeshift laser cannon put it  back onto your horse and onto the next spot  
you can also use your bow to turn around and  shoot to activate those while you're riding  
this is kind of like aiming a battleship  but on land with a horse with lasers  
Find Pristine Weapons
next part head to this spot directly south of  Lookout Landing if you want some stronger melee  
weapons head down into the giant ominous hole  in the ground and use your paraglider as soon  
as you open up into the underground area head  over to this location close by to the Northeast  
you'll see a shadowy figure holding a weapon and  another one close by unlike most of the weapons on  
the surface that are all rusted and degraded these  weapons are in pristine condition and have higher  
base damage values go into your materials section  sort by fuse attack power and pick one of your  
best materials to combine with these this isn't  the only spot you can find these pristine weapons  
they're scattered all around in the Underworld  so head back here if you need to stock up  
you can make some really strong starter weapons  with these but I wouldn't advise using a diamond  
Find A Great Fairy Fountain
a cool horse some powerful weapons and  an expanded inventory which concludes  
the main part of this guide but here is a  little extra credit if you want to go do it  
to find a great fairy fountain in order to  start upgrading your armor take your horse  
all the way along this road to the Northwest right  by Rito Village to find the lucky clover Gazette  
except the quest that the lady in there gives you  and then fast travel back to Lookout Landing then  
you're gonna head Northeast to Woodland stable  here you'll find the Pelican guy that you maybe  
met in Lookout Landing and this music group in  need of help they ask you to fix up their broken  
wagon and you are gonna do so by giving it some  fresh new Wheels attach that to your horse and  
then take them up the left fork in the road to the  nearby fairy fountain with the puff of pink smoke  
Build Drivable Cars & Boats
above it that completes the quest and lets you  talk to the Great Fairy there which can upgrade  
the defensive value of your armor if you have the  associated materials it requires and this last  
one is mostly just for fun if you want to start  messing around with the drivable Vehicles early on  
to the east of Lookout Landing right by the river  you'll find a spot that has a steering unit right  
near this rock a rocket and some energy canisters  which let attached devices run for much longer  
you can use these to build a controllable  boat or some kind of weird car thing  
here's my very first attempt at a rocket van and  the test drive went so horribly wrong I'm not even  
Conclusion
going to show you the footage well at least the  thing had not one but two Kitchens on board turns  
out it's much easier to just use fans instead  of rockets for your basic ground-based vehicles
that's it hope it helps and if you find anything  useful towards the start of Tears of the Kingdom  
hit me up with its location on Twitter at  Boomstick Alex or you can post it down in the  
comments for everyone else to go check out also  consider sticking around on the channel because I  
have more Zelda breakdowns in the works one of  which is a gameplay tips video that you gotta  
see I crammed so much into that thing and it's  probably out by the time you're watching this  
as always I'm Alex thanks for watching  and I'll see you real soon in the next one
