When your legs `don't work-like` they used to before    [I `dont know]
And I can't `sweep-you off-of your feet`                [I can't do it][cup-of coffee]
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart `could still fall-as hard` at 23       [hard != heart]
And `I'm thinking-'bout how` people fall-in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall-in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart    [..art]
I'm thinking-out loud                  [loud vs now][light vs night]
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my `hair's all but gone` and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you-will [you'll] still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinking-'bout how people fall-in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plannnnnnnnnnn
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understandddd.

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oohhh

So baby nowww
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, `place your head on my beating heart`
I'm thinking-out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)
And we found love right where we are
