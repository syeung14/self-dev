bohemian rhapsody


Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no `sympathy`,  [同情]
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Me, to me

Mamaaa,
Just killed-a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on `as-if` nothing really matters     [zip]

Too late, my time has come,
Sends `shivers` down my spine, body's aching all     [goosebump]
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I see a little `silhouetto` of a man,                  [`sil-la-rap-to]   [暗色轮廓/contour]
Scaramouch, `Scaramouch`, will you do the `Fandango`!    [s-ke-re-`mo-chh] [胆小鬼] [胡闹；方丹戈舞]

Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very `frightening me      [frigh-ening - gar-ening]
Galileo, `Galileo`       [伽利略][ga-li-le-o]
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, `Figaro` - `magnificoo`    [显要人物；权贵；贵族][`fi-ga-ro] [man-`ni-fi-co]

I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from-a poor family,
Spare him his life from this `monstrosity`    [畸形；可怕的东西；残暴]
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
`Bismillah`! No, we will not let you go     [以真主的名义起誓]
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
`Beelzebub` has a devil `put aside` for me, for me, [魔王，恶魔][bel-el-zi-beb] [forget or disregard sth]
For meee                                            [put aside - save it for later]

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows...
