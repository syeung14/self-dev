You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down
Oh no

Cadillac Sevilles, coupe Devilles
Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real
Lose your tooth and nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it
Stupid you will feel
What I do, I do at will
Shooting from the hip, yeah, boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my deathbed
Screaming, "F that" yeah, super ill
Baby, what the deal?
We can chill, split half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak, slut
I'll cut my toes off and step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fucking drill
How you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?
Summers Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby, crank the shit
'Cause it's your goddamn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shawty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
"Settle ya fuckin' ass down I'm ready for combat, man"
Get it? Calm Batman
Nah, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like mom's CAT scans
'Cause they fucking go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spazz like a goddamn Taz', yeah

You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down
Oh no

Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with a Etch-A-Sketch
Betcha that you'll never guess who's knocking at your door
People hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with
Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, motherfucker
You ain't gotta lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their draws
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef
Laying on your kitchen floor
Other words I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back
Bring me two extension chords
I'ma measure my dick, shit, I need six inches more
Fuck my dick's big, bitch
Need I remind you that I don't need
The fucking swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here
Need a fix, ock? I'm the big shot
Get it, dick-snots?
Your just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
'Fore I sit back and let 'em get hotter
Better call the cops on 'em quick fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with half a six pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitched attached to the back (dispatch)

You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down
Oh no

Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping?
Does a bird chirp, Lil' Wayne slurps syrup 'til he burps and smokes purp'?
Does a word search gets circles wrapped around it like
You do when I come through? I'd like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Oh, your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Sike, I'm spiking you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Gotta pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimme good brain
Watch the woodgrain, don't want no cum stain
Bitch, you listening tryna turn me down
Slut, I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane? Tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder there's lightening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations
On four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psychopath
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dance floor, cutie, while I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty, shawty, I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doodi?

You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down
Oh no
