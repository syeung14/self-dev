"Mr Brightside"

Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me gooooooooooo
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis []
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eeeeeeeeeeager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

Dress now, let meeeeeeeee gggggggo
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis [evidence not at scene]
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eeeeeeeeeeager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I never...
I never...
I never...
I never...
