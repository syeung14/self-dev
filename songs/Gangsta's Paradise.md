American History X 
Dangerous Minds
```

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone

But I ain't never `crossed` a man that didn't deserve it    
Me be treated-like-a punk, you know that's-unheard-of     [that'sun-heard-of[]
You better watch how you're talkin', and where you're walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined-in chalk    [line-din]   [dead scene]

I really hate `to trip` but I gotta `loc`  [tuh-trip][describes the actual taking of drugs][trip-upset/sth-off/act crazy/lose yo cool/overreact]
                                                    [to form into dreadlocks][gangstered up.]
As they `croak`, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool    [croak:to die/to speak in a hoarse throaty voice]
I'm the `kinda G` the little homies wanna be like       [little -> liddle]
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the `hood team`    [an urban neighborhood - low soc. status]
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams

I'm-an educated fool with money on my mind        [I'man educated....]
Got my ten in my hand and a `gleam` in my eye     [shine brightly:闪烁]
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set `trippin' banger`     [Road Trip Bangers]Loc'd -> "gangstered up."]
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool

Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life, do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going, I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they `front`, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool [front=slang:show off]

Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives, livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
