[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's `vomit` on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti    
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, `blaow`
`Snap` back to reality, `ope` there goes gravity, ope        [slap] [night, light]
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's `dope`
He knows that but he's broke, he's so `stagnant`, he knows
When he goes back to this `mobile` home, that's when it's
`Back to` the lab again, yo, this old `rhapsody`
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you `better [beder]` never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM&t=121s
His `soul's escaping` through this hole that `is gaping [gape/hole]`
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's     [one that is very prominent/talent]
`Close to post-mortem`, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows    [to - `tuh`]
He's known as the `Globetrotter`, lonely roads      [a person who travels widely]
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the `cold water`
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next `schmoe` who flows        [shi-mo][dude/simp]
He nose-dove and sold `nada`, and so the `soap opera`     [nada-nothing`]
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM&t=165s
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuAzR2XVAM&t=188s
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
`Tear` this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been `chewed up` and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next `cypher`
Best believe somebody's payin' the `Pied Piper`          [dark fairy tail]
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
`Five and I` can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no `Mekhi Phifer`, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus `teeter-totter`
Caught up between bein' a father and a `prima donna`  [pretending to be famous/diva]a very temperamental person with an inflated view of their own talent or importance.
Baby mama drama, `screamin`' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in `Salem's Lot`
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
