## [Bedford - Stepping stones A guided approach to writing sentences ....]
- Ch11 - simple sentence
  *
  * Prepositional phrases
- Ch12  
  * Compound: 
    - a comma and a conjunction (`and`-combination, `but`-contrast, `or`-alternatives and `so`-result) + (for, nor, yet
    - Compound subject, compound verb
  * `Soft` period p314
    - with a semicolon `;`
      - Watching basketball is fun; playing it is better.
  * Building longer compound sentences (`type a, b`)
    * p318 - `descriptive words` (adjectives+adverbs) and `prepositional phrase`
      - 
  * `Run-ons` and comma splices (p334)
    - Class ended, then we left (x)
    - p338 - `personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, additive expressions, transitional expressions` (sentence variety)
      - fix with conjunction or use a semicolon followed by the above types ^^^
    - Transitional expressions (p345)
      - My uncle refused to pay his bill; furthermore, he wrote a rude message.
      - [with a semicolon (alone or with a transitional expression followed by a comma)]
      - Tom added lighter fluid; however, the charcoal would not ignite.
  * 
- Ch13 - The Complex Sentence
  * Coordinating conjunctions (and/but/so/or (nor, yet, for))
    - Our team won, so we celebrated
    - Since our team won, we celebrated
  * `Subordinating conjunctions` p355
    - after/as/before/when/while/ (combination)
    - although/even though/       (contrast)
    - because, since              (result)
    - if/even if/unless/until     (alternatives/possibilities)
  * p366 Forming and punctuating complex sentences - subordinating conjunction
  * building sentence variety (p367) with subordinating conjunction (`type c, d`)
    - p368 table for sentence variety (different style/meaning)
    * Transitional exressions - p368:
      - futhermore / in addition / moreover
        if,evenif, unless, until/ on the other hand
```
  However, assigning a different type of task to each worker does not scale well; if several more people show up, it is not obvious how they can help without getting 
  in the way or significantly restructuring the division of labor.
```
  * p373 (punctuation)
    - subordinating conjunction in the middle of a sentence
  * sentence fragment (p374)
    - is a word group that is missing a subject or verb or that doesn't express a complete thought.
    - 
- Ch14 More Complex Sentences
  * `Descriptive Clause` (they appear directly after the word they describe)
    * The team that won celebrated
  * Understanding glue words used in clauses: p384
    - 
  * that 
    *  The pipe that broken was frozen.
  * which 
    * the cookbook, which was a birtyday gift, has many color photos.
  * who/whom
    * the patient who fainted fell down.
    * the girl whom Jim invited could not come.
                    ^^^ another noun or pronoun
    * p394
  * where 
    * the club where we danced closed down.
  * when
    * The summer when I graduated was fantastic.
  * that / whom could be left out
    * noun + verb
  * `that or which` - necessary or optional information
  * `where or when `
  * building longer sentences with clauses
  * building sentence variety (p400) - use everything together!
    - 
  [sentence example]
  https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/functional-programming-in/9781941222690/f_0028.html#:-:text=If%20any%20name%20was%20longer%20th,e%2C%20Steve%20in%20this%20example.
  `If any name was longer than the given base, it would get picked up; otherwise the function would return the base value, Steve in this example`

- Ch15 - modifying phrases
  * There are twp simple sentences, instead of having two separate subjects and verbs, we can `turn one of them into a modifying phrase.`
    - writing more `musical` sentences
    * and `-ing` phrase (present participle): one action that is ongoing at the same time as another
    * a `to` phrase (infinitive phrase): a desired action / goal
    * an `-ed` phrase (past participle):  condition of someone or something

  * the Criminal entered the courtroom. He smiled at the jury.
    * `Entering the courtroom,` the criminal smiled at the jury.
  * Howling at the moon, my dog wakes up all the neighbors.
  * Running for the bus, Dominic tripped on a garden hose. (ongoing)

  * To get to work on time, I catch the six o'clock again. (desired action)
    * In order to get to work on time, I catch the six o'clock train.
  * To find a girlfriend, my cousin tried an online dating service.

  * Injured during the tryouts, the gymnast could not compete in the Olympics. (condition)
  * Lost in the amusement park, the child started to cry. 
  * Stolen on New Year's Day, my car was never found.
  * Damaged during the moe, our antique clock will not keep the correct time.

  * when the modifiers are `in the begining` of a sentence: 
    * The subject of the sentence must come immediately after the comma.
    * This subject must connect with the action in the modiﬁer.
  * `in the middle` or `at the end`
    * The Judge, annoyed by the attorney, called a recess.
    * Deirdre fell into a deep sleep listening to classical music.
  * Avoid misplaced modifier - modifiers are right before and after the words the phrase is describing.

  * How to start a sentences: p432
    - modifying phrase
      1: the subject of the sentence must come immediately after the comma.
      2: the subject must connnect with the action in the modifier.
    - transitional expressions
    - prepositional phrases
    - A simple adverb
    - 

  [example]
  * The Java 8 CompletableFuture API provides the thenCompose method specifically for this purpose, 
    allowing you to pipeline two asynchronous operations, passing the result of the first operation to the second operation when it becomes available.

EventAccess needs to know which accounts have which datasource packages started so that it knows which sources/account notifications to create bundles for.


So here's what we discovered is happening for the impacted customer in prod-dub (and potentially other customers yet to be determined):
* In the past, the customer had a graph and one of the accounts in the graph exceeded guardrails limits so that graph got turned off
* Sometime after that, the customer created a new graph, invited member accounts, but the account that caused the previous graph to go over guardrails did not get accepted into the new graph due to its large ingest amount.  That high ingest account ended up in a pending state
* With the increase to 10 TB limit today, that pending account was no longer ingesting above our guardrails so we re-invited it back to the new graph.  The volume for that account is extremely high compared to the existing accounts in the graph so our big concern now is customers getting a surprise bill increase and harming customer trust

Our next steps are:
* Gather a listed of impacted customers across all regions who fall into this category of having a large volume pending account automatically accepted now with the 10 TB limit increase.  We're also going to attempt to the free trial status for each of those automatically accepted accounts.  We're targeting having this data by end of tomorrow.
* Once we have this list, sync up with @abc on reaching out to these customers and aligning on messaging.  We discussed a potential future option being a metering amendment for some of these customers depending on the results of those customer conversations, but that exact plan is not set in stone yet until we acquire more data on customer impact and have conversations with customers.
Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

We've determined that only 2 customer will be impacted by the issue.  That customer would potentially see a significant surprise increase in their bill for March (and future months).  Therefore, I've asked Rich to reach out to the customer and let them know about this ahead of time so the customer can determine if they'd like to keep that account enabled and whether or not we should do any metering amendment for them to retain customer trust.
Paula also verified that the Extraction and MSS concerns seen earlier in prod-dub have subsided so there are not active concerns for system stability relating to the 10 TB increase.
If you have further questions, feel free to reach out, but special thanks to 
--, __
 and 
 ___
 for their efforts to root cause the issue, and dive deep to pull the data necessary to understand customer impact.

I have not heard if there’s anything you can do in terms of disputing Forte feedback, other than working with your current manager. However, it sounds like your current manager is aware of the situation and shouldn’t be a big deal moving forward. I’d say that the fact that your previous manager ghosted is not a good look on him/her. Is there any way you can discuss this with your current manager and see if your current manager can reach out to your previous manager to set up time to discuss? (edited) 

Other than that, I would say be mindful of whom you request Forte feedback from. I’ve gotten pretty un-useful and irrelevant feedback in the past and realized I probably shouldn’t have requested feedback from those particular people. Additionally, I hope there was still some helpful/relevant feedback for you. I think Forte feedback is really up to you on how you want to take it. I only take action on feedback that resonates with me, and pretty much ignore the rest (as they didn’t have useful datapoints). I would say it’s up to you on how you want to take/accept the feedback, and use it for growth (which is the point). If some of it doesn’t resonate with you, I would just ignore it, and continue to work closely w/ your manager. Hope this helps!

Based on the title of this ticket I can try to get information in us-cent-1 but are there particular regions these accounts have a graph?
