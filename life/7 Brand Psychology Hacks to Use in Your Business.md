Brand Psychology
(light music)
Right, first of all, what is brand psychology, right?
So let's start by reading just a few definitions
of what a brand is and then what psychology is
because there are so many definitions of both.
So let's kind of come to a common understanding,
and then I'm gonna give you those seven secrets
that you can apply to your brand.
So the American Marketing Association says that
a brand is a name, term, design symbol or any other feature
that uniquely identifies one seller's goods or services
from other ones.
So it's basically the things that make you,
you in the market.
And that can be all sorts of different symbols.
So it can be like your logo,
which is what everybody thinks of,
down to your catch phrases or even a specific scent,
if you have a brick and mortar business.
I mean, think about walking by
an Abercrombie store in the mall.
They're branding, and they're becoming recognizable,
just through that insane amount of cologne
that they spray in their store.
Father of advertising, David Ogilvy,
I am so ashamed.
I don't know if I'm pronouncing his last name right,
but he says a brand is an intangible sum
of a product's attributes.
And then from businessdictionary.com says
brands help harried consumers in a crowded and complex
market place by standing for certain benefits
and virtues, or values.
My definition is that a brand is this intentional
alignment over time.
So you're continually shaping the way
that your ideal client perceives you,
through all of those different triggers and symbols.
So it's shaped by all of the touchpoints with your brand,
and also by the cultural context that you're living in.
So intentional alignment over time.
Now the psychology side of things, let's see,
a really simple and useful one is from the
American Psychology Association who say,
it's the study of how the mind works
and how it affects behavior.
So I think it's obvious why psychology is so important
in branding, right, because if we're selling to humans,
we have to know what makes them act in a specific way.
We have to appeal to their human instincts,
whether they're conscious of them or not, right?
So let's get into the seven brand psychology strategies
that you can apply to make your brand even more amazing.
And this isn't a conclusive list,
but these are some of my favorites that I use
when I'm working with my clients one-on-one
or in my brand new brand program.
People make Emotional Decisions
(light music)
The first secret is that you have to understand
that humans make decisions emotionally first.
Then they back it up with logic.
So your brand has to meet them at that emotional level.
I have another video that explains ways
that you can add emotion into your brands,
so watch that one next if you want some more tricks
and tactics to do that.
But essentially, we want to convey a specific personality,
we want to tell stories, use images, everything that's going
to hit your ideal client at the heart and gut level,
as oppose to just appealing to their brain,
as in what is going to make them ultimately choose you.
And then we'll also need to back things up with logic.
So why logically should somebody choose
your product or service?
You can't just have a purely emotional plea or argument,
that'll get you so far but you have to back it up
with that logic so that once that buyer's remorse
kicks in, they can rationalize
why they bought your brand in the first place.
(light music)
People are Social
The second secret psychological key
is to understand that humans are social.
We're constantly paying attention to the people
and things that influence us.
And we're building our identity
within that social construct.
Like so our base brain, like our reptile brain doesn't
ever want us to be cast out from the tribe.
This goes back to our caveman and hunter gatherer days.
It would be dangerous to just completely stand alone.
So we're being influenced by everybody around us.
Think about the restaurant that has
like a line out the door.
That one's automatically more appealing,
even if there's one right next door
that is completely open and ready to serve you food.
Logically, that doesn't make sense.
But because humans are social animals,
our psychology supports that.
We want to show ways that ...
We wanna create that social safety within our own brands.
We can do this by using testimonials,
by showing how many people follow us on social media,
by having case studies, or just by even interacting
with other influential peers.
It shows that other people trust us,
so they can trust us too.
Humans Share Universal Values
(light music)
Secret number three is to connect your brand
with some universal human values.
I love doing this with brand archetypes.
Because it tells us that we need to like bring our message
down again to that like heart and gut level.
We don't wanna just talk about our product's features
or benefits or whatever.
We need to connect to their human universal values
if we want people to truly pay attention
and to value us.
So things like love, community, achievement, individuality,
all of these things are connected to the different 12
archetypes that I use with my clients
as we're defining their brand's stories.
And if you'd want to know what your brand archetype is
to help connect to one of those deeper universal values,
definitely check out the brand archetype,
the brand personality quiz on my site.
It's been taking over 80,000 times and that number is
growing so quickly, we're almost to a 100k.
But I'll save that announcement for later.
(chuckles)
People Have Short Attention Spans
(light music)
The fourth secret psychological hack or trick
or technique, strategy, whatever word best suits
your temperament that we can tap into
is understanding how human attention works.
So we need to first get people to pay attention to us,
to notice us, before they're going to stick around
for any length of time.
Like our attention spans are ridiculously short,
and there's a few different ways that we can do that.
Let me just share with you two techniques that you can use
here in this video to get you started.
So first is by giving people context.
Like being a mirror to them.
So for example, if you're at a cocktail party,
and you hear your name, it doesn't matter if somebody's
talking about you, like, your ears perk up.
So if you can identify with your ideal client
to show that you understand them
and that you're talking about them,
specifically in your brand,
that's gonna get them to like perk up and to notice.
Even within the sea of sameness.
Brains Seek Patterns
(light music)
Alright, psychological number five is to understand
that the brain always works in making connections.
It's always looking for patterns to understand
that the world around you.
So you can create shortcuts to understanding
that your clients or ideal clients or audience
can pick up on to understand like what your deeper
message is, in a very very quick way.
So an example of this, again going back to the brand
archetypes, is that there're associations
that we make based on what fonts a brand is using,
what images they're using, what archetype
they're primarily associating their brand with,
all of those things that build up this very clear
set of associations in your clients' minds
that help them understand you.
So you don't have to write a novel
about what your brand stands for.
You can use some of those psychological triggers
to communicate that to them.
(light music)
Psychological number six is a weird one.
(laughs)
So the more that we see something,
a person's face, a logo, anything,
the more that we see something, the more that we like it.
It's going back to that reptile brain
that's trying to keep us safe, right?
Anything that's new or novel is exciting
but maybe it's dangerous, like strangers. (giggles)
Stranger, danger.
Careful, this person might be trying to harm me
or trick me or whatever.
But if I see somebody a lot,
I begin to like them a lot.
And you can play into this by just consistently showing up.
Even if you're not doing anything else right.
If you're just showing up where your ideal clients are,
and where they can see you,
that consistency is gonna build trust over time.
Distraction Triggers Engagement
(light music)
Alright, the seventh psychological secret
that you can tap into is to understand the reward system
in your ideal client's brain.
So we're constantly looking for hits of dopamine,
the distraction hormone in our brain.
So if you can provide content that isn't just factual
or useful, but also really entertaining or novel
or exciting or just something that's fun to watch,
you're going to be lighting up those pleasure systems
in people's minds.
You're giving those people the ah ha moment
that give them that hit of dopamine
that just feel good hormone that's in the brain
that makes people wanna keep coming back
again and again to your brand.
So import one, import all, but understand the fact
that psychology is a core determining factor
if your brand is going to be a success or not.
So it makes sense to pay attention to how our brains work.
'Cause we're all selling to humans.
