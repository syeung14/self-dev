[4 Truths To Grow Self-Love | Robin Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YOzx9IYdFY)

hi it's Robin Sharma the author of the 5
M Club and 
I really hope you're great, I
hope you are in `hot pursuit` of your
mighty mission, I hope you're
`materializing` your `primal genius`, I hope
you are radiating positivity to every
person you meet, I hope you are
manifesting your greatest productivity I
hope you're living not only a successful
life today but a `soulful life` and in
this specific `mastery session` I'm gonna
walk you through four truths to grow
self-love, 

now you may say to me Robin
self-love we come to you for leadership
mentorship Robin we come to you for elite
performance advice Robin we come to you
for your tactics on `exponential productivity` or 
building a great company
or having service to humanity, what are
you talking about self love? 

well I think in many ways self love is the starting
point to world class, and you've never
heard me say that before, but the way you
are in the world is a `deep reflection` of
the way you are with yourself, you know,
your `prosperity` and your income is
always a reflection of your
self-identity, your daily behavior is
always a reflection of your deepest
beliefs, you're not going to go out in
the world, out in the world, and represent
your highest creativity, productivity and
`mastery` if you hate yourself, you're not
going to be kind to people on the street,
smile at strangers, uplift the teammate,
Wow a customer, if you're full of hatred
about who you truly are, and I think this
is one of the missed ideas and one of
the missed truths in the world today, the
doorway to success really does open
inward, it doesn't open outward and I've
seen so many people even some of the
people I coach, you know, these people
they learn the intellectual ideas to
build an empire, and I also teach them
how they multiply productivity and I
also teach them how do you scale your
fortunes and build a life of joy, peace,
beauty, and freedom, and yet some of them
here's what they do

they `tear it all down`, we get to these
amazing results through our coaching
together and they hit an inflection
point, or they start to `self-sabotage`
maybe they start to drink too much, maybe
`they start to be rude to the people` on
their team, maybe they start to `pick fights` with their significant other,
maybe they start to get too distracted
by digital media and they start to `tear it all down`, it is a huge act of
self-sabotage and I've seen it for so
many years working with the best of the
best, why does that happen, well, it
happens because `you will never rise any higher than the way you see yourself on the outside,`
if you don't feel you are
deserving of beauty prosperity, acclaim,
fame, fortune, impact on society, if you
don't really feel you deserve it, because
you feel like you're not enough, you
really don't like yourself, you're
suffering from what psychologists call
`impostor syndrome`, then you're gonna read
the books, you're gonna watch these
mastery sessions, you're gonna go to the
courses, you're gonna do the work but you
are going to reach a point where your `mindset becomes in conflict with your heart set,`
if you don't know these for
interior empires, I'm always talking
about mindset, heart set, health set, and
soul set, read about them and learn about
them in the 5 a.m. Club, my latest book

but the larger point is simply this,
think about this idea of `self-sabotage`
and it all comes from a lack of
self-love, you know, if as a child you
didn't receive appreciation from your
parents, if as a child you might have
received physical love or physical
caring but that `heart set need` that need
for love and appreciation that need for
human validation, if you didn't get that
from your parents so you didn't get that
from your teachers or you didn't get
that from your early `influences`, well,
`here's what's gonna happen` you're gonna
be suffering, and I use the word
intentionally you're going to be
suffering from these heart set, wounds of neglect, emotional and neglect
and you're not gonna like yourself very
much and especially in this culture of
comparison
you're gonna those wounds are going to
be activated every single day, you're
gonna walk out in the world and you're
gonna look at your device and you're
gonna see all these people showing you a
`highlight reel` of the lives, they want
you to think they're living, most of it's
just an `illusion`, I was reading recently
there is actually a service where you
`can rent a jet on a runway` and for 20
minutes you can go to the runway, and get
a photographer to take pictures of you
on a private jet and outside of the
private jet, you know like this, right and
you get to post it on social media, and
you can hire photographers to take you
to all these `luxury brand stores` or
you're outside of a luxury brand store,
and you're like outside a luxury brand
store, maybe even if you can't afford the
watch or the purse or the shoes or
whatever it is, what is the point, I'm
suggesting to you, `everything begins within`, if you don't love yourself then
you're gonna go out into the world, and
in this culture of show business, this
`culture of bling`, this culture of [bling: flashy jewelry worn especially as an indication of wealth or status]
comparison, this culture of social media
gratification, you're gonna get activated
you're gonna `get pinged`, those `ancient runes` are gonna get touched on every
single day and you're just gonna be
miserable and so four truths to help you
grow self-love, so that you build that
inner warrior and this place of peace
and this huge well of tranquility that
`cannot be disrupted` when you go out into
the world is what is really
mission-critical, right you want to be so
strong in your skin, so strong in your
`luminosity` so strong in your
relationship with who you truly are, that
nothing in the outer world can activate
you, and diminish your energy, and make
you feel not enough, you know what
Eleanor Roosevelt said, my friend `no one can insult you without your permission, `
you know what Oscar Wilde said
he said `be yourself everyone else is taken`
you know what Warren Buffett once said
`there can never be a better you than you`  
you know what Jack well said when he was
at GE `do not lose yourself on the way to the top` 
so let me walk you through four
specific truths that will help you grow
self-love: 

number one `honor your specialness, honor your specialness`
look we've got billions of people on this
tiny planet and yet there is no other
person alive today quite like you, no one
quite like you, the gifts that you have
no one quite like the way that you talk,,
no one has the same fingerprints, no one
walks exactly in the same way as you, no
one has the same hopes and dreams as you,
no one `has had the same sufferings` that
you have, no one has become precisely the
same person that you are, no one has the
same potential you have, no one has
exactly the same primal genius that
lurks[潜伏；埋伏] at your core that makes you       [lure != lurk]
special 
now I'm not suggesting that you
fall into what I call WRAM syndrome WRAM
`world revolves around me` look I'm so
special, I'm entitled, I'm so special,
world give me a great living, I see that
all over the world, we live in this
society of great entitlement, people
don't want to show up early, people are
not committed to mastery in all cases, 
a lot of people are like give to me and they've become takers from their organizations, 
and their marketplaces and their society  versus understanding you get from the world what you give to the world, 
but the point on this first truth
is honor your specialness, appreciate who
you are, there is no one quite like you.

the second truth to grow self-love is `to do hard things daily` 
and I want you to think about this one really `intimately`
right here right now
when you get up every day, are you on the
path of `least resistance`, I, you know,
someone said to me on one of my social
feeds the other day, Robin I've read the
5 a.m. Club, loved the information, full
of energy to get it done, but I need to
tell you, it sounds very easy, it's much
harder to do in real life, well, 
what is this love we all have in this world, 
we live in,... of things needing to be easy?

society has sold us a bill of goods,
you know, everything should be easy, we
should transform our health with one
quick pill, you know, a great relationship
should've happened in a month and if we don't
have a magical relationship, we're not
all in love and Wonder then we should
leave the relationship, if we're in a job,
you know, anything that's worth doing is
challenging at first, and if we're at a
job.  Oh after three months if it's not the
job of my lifetime, we leave it, in a
relationship, you know if it's not
perfect, we leave it, if we want to
upgrade our health, oh I've been at it
two weeks, oh you know what, it's really
hard, I need to stop my journey to
world-class fitness, what's my point, my
point is simply this, anything great you
will ever do in your life is hard, and so,
are you living everyday? let me ask you
right now in this moment, I am blessed to
share with you when you get up in the
morning when you go through your day,
when you construct your evening routine,
is it all around the path of least
resistance? is it all about pleasure, is
all about fun? is it all about are you a
master of easy? or are you doing what the
very few do on the planet today? as you
know one of my core brain tattoos is to
have the results 95% of the population
do not have, you've got to commit to
doing what only 5% of the population are
willing to do, and `what the Titans do,`
what the `virtuosos` do, what the
`Exceptionalist do`, they build their days
around, the pursuit of difficult things
and if you do that, here's what happens, you're gonna
build a momentum, and if you do that, each
day will be a platform for growth but
even more importantly, how do you build
self-respect, it's by doing difficult
things, when you say, I'd like to watch a
video in the evening or my favorite TV
show, but tonight I commit to spending
time with my child who wants my
attention and who needs me, you grow in
self-respect, when you say I'm going to
get up at 5 a.m. and I'm gonna run this 20
20 20 formula that Robin teaches and
that has literally helped millions of
people upgrade their morning routine and
their energy, productivity, creativity
impact, you grow in self-respect, when you
say I'm not gonna `coast through` my day [coast: to sail along the shore of]
today I'm gonna do something that's
gonna give me a micro win, so my work and
my crafts gets a little better you grow
in self-respect, if each day you do
difficult things, and make these daily
optimizations, each day through the doing
of micro difficulties you build greater
self-respect and as you build greater
self-respect you fall in love with
yourself, it's a great way to build
self-love I mean one of the tactics to
remember is how do you grow self-love
`you consistently make and then keep self promises` 

which brings you and I to the
third truth to grow self-love:
go to the woods, go to the woods, we spend so much
time in the noise of life, we forget
about the signal, we spend so much time
and the `frenzy` of society or forget [frenzy - a violent mental or emotional agitation]
about who we truly are, I'm challenging
you with great love and respect, don't
just be a producer, be a philosopher
don't just be out into the world, go to
the wilderness, we are animals, we need to
retreat, but also at our core, we must
spend time in solitude for years, I've
been teaching a philosophy, the 3s
philosophy `solitude` `silence` and
`stillness` solitude silence and stillness
in this world right now of such digital
distraction, such social media comparison, 
such busy being busy, we wake up in the
morning sometimes, there's so many emails,
so many notifications, we must make the
time to go to the woods, physically or
metaphorically, and when you find that
time to practice the 3 s's of silent
solitude and stillness, 
here's what happens, you remember who you truly are,
you remember your priorities, you can
build the `intimacy and fluency` with your
primary relationship, and the primary
relationship, I suggest to you who you
truly are, you're not your past, you're
not your weaknesses, you're not your
false beliefs, you're not your `hypnosis`,
you're not your genius betrayals, when
you start to spend time alone in the
woods in solitude, in reflection, that's
when you can say, I am NOT my wounding, I
am NOT my hatred, I am NOT my insecurity,
I am NOT my sorrow, I am NOT my fears, I
am NOT my `stumblings`, you start to hear
the `quiet whispers of your greatest self`
and you start to remember you are
luminosity, you are a hero, you're not a
victim, you're a leader, you have this
goodness within you, this deep creativity
within you, there's great power within
you that longs to see every day and the
more you spend time in the woods alone
remembering who you truly are,
it's like any other relationship, you
spend time with it, you nurture it, you
grow it, you become aware of it, it gets
stronger and stronger, and then you
become this force of nature, out in a
world of so many people who have
forgotten who they truly are, and you
stand as an army of one of possibility
and leadership and strength, 

forth truth to grow self-love is simply this, the
more people you help, the more love
you'll grow, the more people you'll help,
the more you will expand, if you really want to
times 25 yourself love, times 25 your
commitment to impact, you know, mother
Teresa said it really well, it's: as you
help more people, you love yourself even
more greatly, and it's Martin Luther King
jr. and I'll paraphrase him, he said, you
know we all can be great, because
greatness is not about education,
greatness is not about your position,
greatness is not about your past, every
single day we all can be helpful, and so
each day we all can become great, and so
I found personally the more I shift the
focus off of any elements of fame,
fortune, applies, getting more likes and
the more I obsess and make it this
`monomaniacal` driven mission that doesn't
  - [: mental illness especially when limited in expression to one idea or area of thought]
come from the ego, that comes from
servant to it to help more people
through the information I share in the
world, the more joy I see in my own life,
the more I pursue helpfulness, the more
peace I fill up with and this episode is
certainly not about me, this episode is
all about you, I just want to share my
own personal experience which is the
more I get the focus and spotlight off
of any personal rewards, and really not
only intellectually but emotionally
where real transformation comes from
from the `heart set` that's why, it's so
important, a strong mindset without a
pure heart set is an empty victory, and
when you do that heart set work, so that
you turn down the voice of the low-grade
emotions, like anger and shame and guilt
and sorrow and when you upgrade your
commitment to self-love and gratitude
and serve into it, it's amazing
what rewards, you'll start to see in your
own life, so I hope this episode has been
valuable for you, inspirational, tactical,

and I'll see you in the next episode
