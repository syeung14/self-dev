self-confident:
words like "good", "cant'", "try", "maybe", "failed", etc. produce images
of uncertainty and doubt. However, if we substitute them with words like "great,", "do",

decisive and positive words
if you make a new habit of using assetive, positive language, you can gain the upper hand in both your
personal and business relationships.
