https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogL1P7QJc7M

Can you say it please?
Emotional damage.
Ah, that's good.
Hi, I'm Josh.
I'm Ollie.
I'm Stephen He, AKA Uncle Roger.
He's not Uncle Roger.
We are currently in Chinatown.
Yes, New York City!
New York.
We asked for your recommendation.
Yes, and it's very Chinese.
Is this where we're eating?
Yes, right here in that shack.
Look at this.
Tony's Fresh Rice Noodle.
Hell yeah.
They're called cheung fun.
They're like my number one favourite food in the world.
I love it.
I ate it every day growing up.
I don't know what cheung fun is.
Oh, we'll have to show you, I'm so excited, let's go!
Wait, hang on a second...
We just walked into Tony's Fresh Rice Noodle in Chinatown, yeah?
What is this?
Hello, could I get one beef rice roll with egg,
One pork rice roll with egg, A Tony's Special,
Three tea eggs please, And one peanut butter sandwich?
Are we missing anything you'd recommend?
Yeah, curry fish balls.
I will take as much of this home as you guys don't need.
Okay, okay.
I love the raw enthusiasm you’ve got for this food.
There it is.
It's huge!
Look at that.
That's how it usually is.
It's massive, really?
The cheung fun I have is like more flat, and there's like three of them on top.
That's like the common little version.
But the thing is a whole meal by itself.
So you've basically just been eating those mini hotel croissants all this time.
Not knowing that real croissants exist.
I guess so!
Oh, I love this, I love this.
You guys are gonna get blown away.
Whoa, these are tea eggs?
Yeah, they're the tea eggs.
Is that a shell?
Yes, that's the shell.
What do you mean?
It's still in the shell, it's not peeled.
I love your shock.
This is steaming, hot, fresh.
It has to be.
It looks amazing.
I'll show you how we usually do it.
Pour the sauces into the thing.
Okay.
And this is like a soy sauce?
Yeah, in Shenzhen, shops would pride themselves on their sauce.
Your shop was the best, that means you got the best sauce.
I see.
The sauce is the thing that they make themselves.
Wow, look at that!
I'm gonna do my first ever, what's it, what is it?
Cheung fun.
Cheung fun.
Okay.
Oh, wow.
That is incredible.
I love this, I love this so much.
I haven't had anything like that before.
The texture...
The texture is crazy.
It's like in the middle of a venn diagram.
Of like gnocchi, ddukbokki, and noodles.
Really soft.
Really soft.
So soft.
You know like the difference when you have like handmade pasta for the first time.
And all you ever tried is like dried pasta.
And then you have that fresh pasta, and it's like kind of a little bit springy.
A little bit chewy.
It's just like that.
Tony's Fresh Rice Noodle.
That's why he's got fresh in the name.
You can really taste it.
So a little bit of history, you grew up in Shenzhen?
Yes, I was born in Shenzhen, China, and I grew up there until I was eight.
And then I immigrated to Ireland.
Sorry, the way you say Ireland is Irish.
It's so weird.
On some words, you have a really strong Irish accent.
Do I?
Yeah, it’s interesting.
"I immigrated to Ireland."
Just one word.
The day I landed, I'll always remember this, because like, the trauma, right?
We arrived in Shannon Airport at about 8AM.
My mom drove me back to the house, said, "Put this uniform on",
And I was in school by noon.
No way.
The day I landed in a completely foreign country, I didn't speak a word.
Across the other side of the world.
Yes, across the other side of the world.
And you were like, "Top of the morning to you!"
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It did stunt like a lot of my social abilities.
As you can imagine, like taking language away from an eight year old.
Yeah, of course, of course.
All of a sudden you couldn't make friends.
Emotional damage.
That was good.
Emotional damage.
The deep roots.
It's all coming out.
Oh, I've been emotional damaged since I was eight.
Now the soy sauce mixture is classic,.
But peanut sauce is a bit of a new hip thing that some people like to try.
It's actually a very textural thing, rather than flavour.
Oh, interesting.
It adds a little bit of thickness to it.
You dip it?
Yes, you just roll it around it.
Amazing.
I love rolling around in sauce.
That's a different channel.
Big thanks to Everydaze, for getting us out to New York for this episode.
I need a whole new self-care routine to deal with the emotional damage from that accent.
These will help.
Konjac jelly is full of vitamin C and collagen.
And they taste flipping great.
It only has 10 calories.
It's vegan.
It will provide your daily dose of collagen, vitamin C.
And they taste good!
It's sugar free, gluten free, cruelty free...
I mean we've been having loads of them.
Well you have.
Throughout this trip.
You have not been cruelty free, because my favourite flavour, mango, you had all of them.
I'm pretty sure Ducky had some of them as well...
My second favourite flavour, peach, you also drank all of those.
Okay.
The point is, they're very good.
Thank you Everydaze for sending us these.
And please send us some more.
Because we are running out.
If like me, you are craving Everydaze's konjac jelly,
You can go to iHerb or Amazon where they're available.
There's also a link in the description.
Add something easy and delicious to your self-care routine.
Before Josh drinks all of them.
Okay.
This is kind of like huoguo style peanut sauce.
Hogwarts?
Not Hogwarts!
That's what I thought at first.
Hotpot.
Sorry, my Chinese tones are all off, so...
Mine too.
I used to speak some Chinese, but now it's terrible.
You're an idiot.
You're right, the texture.
Becomes denser.
It does.
It becomes denser.
You can kind of enjoy the taste for longer.
Now one of your characters in your sketches, I think yourself, is allergic to peanuts.
That was a joke, I'm not actually allergic.
I figured.
Because I just about to stab an EpiPen into your leg.
I am!
Nice to meet you, bro.
You must get that quite a lot, living in New York City.
Yeah, I get it a lot.
Do you like it?
Oh, it's not about me, it's about the person.
What I love is sharing a conversation with them.
Or something to make them smile and make their day.
Because they get really excited.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know why, I'm not that special.
But they'll see me and they'll be like, oh my god, dude, it's you, what?
That's the part I love.
It's about making their day and I never get tired of that.
That's awesome.
That's really cool.
I love as well that you've embraced the emotional damage meme.
There's a lot more to you.
There's a lot more to you than a shareable gif.
Than the emotional damage meme.
And so it would be understandable if you're like,
I don't want to just be known for this one thing.
But I have a thought about that.
Okay, okay.
I do.
It may not...
Hello?
Are you serious?
Yeah, yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
I love that.
Thank you.
No problem.
I'm very, very comfortable being known as one thing now because I believe in failures.
Like right now, emotional damage is huge.
But I know I'll make 10 more things and it's probably not gonna hit.
I'll make 100 more things and it's probably not gonna hit.
I'll make 500 more things and you know, the chances are the next meme,
The next huge trending moment is gonna happen.
And then for a while I'll be known as that thing.
And that's completely fine too because I'll have more.
And then I'll have more and I'll have more.
Great.
That's a really healthy way of thinking about it.
I have made over 300 videos now and people only see the best ones.
Interesting.
We only know Leonardo DiCaprio for his Titanic and his Oscar-winning performances.
We don't know him for the thousands of rejections he got from auditions.
You know, film 100 times, chances are you'll get a decent try in there.
Yeah.
And the opposite side, people don't see those videos anyway.
So what do you have to worry about?
Yeah, yeah.
That's so true.
Sauce on that.
Okay, so I wanna hear about how YouTube happened.
Can you say it please?
Emotional damage.
Oh, that's good.
That's really good.
You know what the accent is?
The accent is basically how I used to speak English.
You would know.
It's nine-year-old Steven in Ireland.
All you do is you take Mandarin's tones and you apply them to English.
Why YouTube?
I mean, obviously making videos is fun.
But from actor to YouTube.
This is gonna sound weird.
I'm actually a very strategic person.
While I was in the pandemic, I was an aspiring actor.
Which, let me summarise that in my favourite joke I've ever written.
Steven tells his dad, I wanna be an actor.
And his dad says, I tell you what, I tell every aspiring actor,
Venti latte with caramel please.
That sums up my 12 years of audition.
Okay.
12 years of auditions?
I started when I was 13.
So that was when I started strategising.
And it just happened that when the pandemic hit,
All of my auditions went away.
And I had booked a very big job as well.
I was very excited for it.
But that went away too.
I was gonna be in a national commercial for IBM.
The computer company.
What?
What does IBM sell anymore?
Computer solutions.
I presume.
What is that?
What is computer solutions?
It's just Steven being like, just pressing the button.
So I landed that.
And I was over the moon, I was jumping up and down, calling my mom.
"Mom, mom, I landed this thing!"
And then the day of the first shoot, New York got locked down.
The day.
I was like, okay, if I keep doing what I've been doing,
Then I'll get nowhere.
So how do I kind of rise above the 99% of my peers who are also doing the same thing?
So I went on Tiktok, made 200 little Tiktoks.
And grew about a million followers.
-Casual. -200 TikToks!
I migrated about 10% over to YouTube, I started a YouTube channel with 100 thousand subscribers.
That's a pretty good starting spot
That's a good strategy.
And it took til I was about 2 million YouTube subscribers.
When emotional damage happened.
It didn't happen immediately.
Right, of course.
It sat there like a kind of sleeping...like a bear, hibernating.
Oh, you made it and uploaded it...
That's what I meant.
So I made the sketch, and it just sat there.
For four months.
What was it like when that happened?
How did that go?
Well it was extraordinary.
In one week, like half of my friends called me and went,
"Steven, get off my For You page.
I can't scroll without seeing your bloody face everywhere!"
Wow!
Went on TikTok, the main hashtag #EmotionalDamage had crossed a billion views.
In one month.
That is extraordinary.
Like, 190 thousand videos made with that sound.
And it's flown the roost too, it's no longer necessarily connected to your video.
It's like a meme independent...
The vast majority of people have never seen the video.
Crazy.
That's so nuts to think about, isn't it?
Alright, curried fish balls.
Really interesting combination.
That's good.
Well that surprised me.
It is exactly what it says on the tin.
It is a fishcake fried in curry sauce.
We have curry sauce in the UK with like, you dip chips in it.
Do you have that in Ireland?
Yeah, we do, yeah.
McDonald's, you can get curry sauce.
I didn't know that.
Go to McDonald's, get a curry.
I'd forgotten that this was sitting here.
I can't believe it.
They toasted it!
There's no jam!
You can tell no-one orders this.
I bet they don't even have any jelly in the back.
I bet you they had one jar that's been sat there for ten years...
And they opened it and it was mouldy, and they were like,
Ahh, it's ok.
They won't even realise if we don't even put it in there.'
That's what the inside looks like.
The PB&J stood for "peanut butter and jack sh*t"
You are obviously a creator now, which everyone under the age of 30 understands, and sees there's prestige...
And everyone over the age of 30 thinks it's basically a joke.
It's not a real job, yeah.
Your parents... how have they taken this evolution in your career?
That's a story.
I started when I was 13, and I told my parents that I wanted to be an actor.
I think they just played it off, like not serious.
Like, you know kids say "I wanna be an astronaut, I wanna be superman!"
Yeah, at 13, yeah yeah.
So there's just like "Ah, whatever."
When I was 17, four years later, we were talking about universities and they're like,
"What do you wanna do?"
"Oh, I applied to this acting degree."
And they were like, "You were serious? What?!"
And they had hesitance... but in the end they supported me all the way.
Wow.
And obviously I couldn't pay the rent, so they helped me to first of all do the degree,
And then to be able to live in London, and audition, and audition, and do these plays that probably paid like 100 bucks.
That whole time.
That's amazing.
Yeah, it is truly extraordinary.
I don't understand why parents do that.
I wouldn't do that for my kids!
And then when you started YouTube...
Here's what it is with Chinese parents.
They will turn when they can use you to show off to other parents.
Ohhh, classic!
So when my mum could tell her friends, "My son got a million followers",
That's when they start supporting you.
My mum loved that.
Especially after 'Emotional damage'.
No she's full of love for it.
She loves talking about that video, sharing it with other parents.
Ah, that's really sweet.
That's cool.
Tea egg.
It really does look like it's been plucked out of a nest.
So this has been sitting in what, like jasmine tea?
I don't know what tea.
Some kind of black tea leaves.
Oh!
Yeah.
That's pretty authentic.
The yolk is... kinda blue.
It is kinda blue.
And it does taste a bit like tea?
And the yolk is blue.
That's normal, right?
I mean no, I'm not asking you!
You literally brought us here.
We're not gonna die, right?
Steven, thank you so much for bringing us here.
This has been a wild ride.
Thank you.
Well, see you in the next episode.
See you JOLLY soon guys!
See you later.
Bye!
Wow.
You're amazing.
That was epic.
That was so good!
Yeah, it was unbelievable.
