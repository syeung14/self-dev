https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqqAB7i-S_Y&t=826s

There's nothing quite like an expensive cut  of meat expertly prepared and served hot to  
your table. Before you head out for a costly  dinner, check out this worst-to-first ranking  
of some of the major U.S. steakhouse chains  to make sure your money will be well spent.
If you're craving a delicious steak, stay  far away from Bonanza Steakhouse. This  
chain tries to combine the best attributes of a  traditional steakhouse and a buffet restaurant,  
but instead, you get high-end steakhouse  prices at discount buffet quality.
Bonanza Steakhouse also serves a wide array of  seafood, chicken, and other American favorites  
that generally underwhelm. If you have to order  off of the menu, order anything but the steak,  
which is the worst of the worst. The best value  at this steakhouse is actually their salad bar.
Bonanza Steakhouse and Ponderosa Steakhouse  are both owned by the same parent company,  
so do yourself a favor and avoid both.
"We come, adorable husband,  because the steaks are delicious.  
Tender, juicy, and cooked just the  way you like them. They're great!"
"No they're not."
When you first walk into Claim Jumper, it looks  like a great choice. This national steakhouse  
chain, which dates back to 1977, has a  fun Western theme that's centered on the  
California Gold Rush of the mid-1800s. During  those times, a claim jumper was someone who  
wrongfully occupied someone else's property,  usually with the hope of finding gold. Today,  
if you make the mistake of going to Claim Jumper,  you, too, will feel like you've been robbed.
Despite the fun vibes and interesting furnishings,  the food is forgettable. No matter what you order  
off of the menu, you won't be pleased. Even if you  think you'll enjoy Claim Jumper's Western theme,  
just watch a Western movie instead — and then  head to a steakhouse that is worthy of your money.
With more than 700 locations in the United States,  
there's a good chance that you've  been to an Outback Steakhouse.  
Unfortunately, that also means there's a  good chance that you've been disappointed.  
Not only is Outback Steakhouse way too expensive  for what you get, compared to other restaurants  
of the same caliber, but the quality of the meat  never lives up to what you see on the commercials.
"In a perfect world, I would be  eating at Chili's constantly.  
But tonight, there's no rules.  Just right. Outback Steakhouse."
Outback Steakhouse is primarily known for its  Australian theme. If you buy into the hype,  
you'd think that this restaurant chain serves  authentic food that Australians eat while they're  
tossing around boomerangs and boxing kangaroos.  But it's clear from the very American offerings  
that the founders had never traveled to the land  down under prior to opening their first location.
The food you'll get at Logan's  Roadhouse isn't too different  
from the offerings at Outback Steakhouse. The  main difference is you get slightly more bang  
for your buck at Logan's Roadhouse,  without the fake Australian shtick.
That said, Logan's Roadhouse is  far from an elite steakhouse.  
You can find tender ribs here, and the Margarita  Cheesecake is legitimately great, but the steaks  
leave a lot to be desired. The flavor is  lacking, and the texture is iffy at best.
One cool thing about Logan's Roadhouse is  that the restaurant gives you a bucket of  
peanuts at your table. Sadly, following multiple  lawsuits related to slipping on peanut shells,  
some locations no longer allow you to throw  the peanut shells on the floor, diminishing  
the restaurant's casual charm. Now, there's  nothing to distract you from the boring food.
With locations all over the world, Wolfgang's  Steakhouse is truly international, but if you're  
in the US, you'll have to find one in New  York, New Jersey, or Hawaii. Is it worth it?
While the steak at Wolfgang's is a lot better than  the steak you find at most casual steakhouses,  
it's not quite good enough to justify the  price tag of about $50 per steak. While the  
rib eye steak is very flavorful, it's just  not notable enough to be worth the money.
The high prices would be easier  to digest if it weren't for the  
fact that Wolfgang's Steakhouses  can get uncomfortable and loud.  
This is not the place to go if you're trying  to have an in-depth conversation with a date.
Also, don't get confused and think that this  steakhouse is the brainchild of Wolfgang Puck.  
This chain comes from a man named  Wolfgang Zwiener. And while Mr.  
Zwiener has more than 40 years  of experience in the industry,  
the confusion caused by the name of  the restaurant resulted in a lawsuit.
Saltgrass Steak House is basically the opposite of  Wolfgang's Steakhouse — both in good ways and bad  
ways, offering an extremely comfortable dining  experience with friendly, attentive waiters,  
relatively low prices, and an impressive  assortment of appetizers and desserts.
Unfortunately, the quality of the  steaks at Saltgrass Steak House just  
isn't there. The restaurant covers all  its steaks with a flood of garlic butter,  
and while that's a tasty gimmick  the first time or two you have it,  
eventually you'll realize that the wool  is being pulled over your eyes. Beneath  
the butter is a steak that lacks the flavor or  the satisfying texture to survive on its own.
If you want to go to a Saltgrass Steak House, you  won't have much luck on either the East Coast or  
the West Coast, but you can find this steakhouse  throughout the heartland if you look hard enough.
Charlie Palmer Steak has locations from the Golden  State to the Big Apple, all of them luxurious. But  
unless you know exactly what you're doing, you're  not guaranteed to be satisfied by your meal.
For starters, you need to know that the seafood  at Charlie Palmer Steak is actually better than  
their steak. Their Yellowfin Tuna Tartare, Citrus  Marinated Wild Baja Prawns, Pan Roasted Seabass,  
and Halibut are all great choices. If you do go  with their steak, be sure you add a sauce like  
Horseradish Cream, Blue Cheese Fondue, or Roasted  Garlic Jus. Otherwise, if you order a steak  
without any sauce, you'll be met with a piece  of meat that looks really good but lacks flavor.
Morton's The Steakhouse claims to have the  best steak anywhere, and at one point in time,  
that may have been true. However, these days,  you're taking a gamble. Sometimes the steaks are  
outstanding, but other times, they're so rubbery  that you'll have a difficult time swallowing.  
Unfortunately, the prices are the  same, no matter what you end up with.
If you're headed to Morton's The Steakhouse,  order the Filet Mignon, which it offers in  
three different sizes starting at six ounces. If  you're lucky, you'll get an amazing steak that you  
will talk about for the rest of the week. But  if you get a steak that has a rubbery texture,  
all you can do is eat as much as you can and take  the rest home for your dog. Fido will be thrilled.
Black Rock Bar & Grill is an interesting concept,  and while this place is unlikely to become your  
favorite steakhouse, it's unique enough that  you should try it at least once in your life.
At Black Rock, your meat is served on a  volcanic rock that's been heated to 755 degrees.  
It's a novel idea, but not the strangest  thing a steak has been served on.
"What is that thing?"
"It's a roof tile."
"Wow. F--k me."
Once you're given your slab of sizzling meat,  you're in charge of the rest of the cooking.  
The best part of the experience is  that every bite of steak promises  
to be as hot and as juicy as your initial bite.
On the other hand, if you wanted to cook your own  food, wouldn't you have just gone to your kitchen  
instead? Black Rock Bar & Grill isn't a place to  kick back, relax, and get lost in conversation.  
It promises to be a memorable dinner — but you'll  be responsible for most of the heavy lifting.
With only 8 far-flung locations,  Shula's Steak House stretches the  
definition of "national chain," but  it's worth mentioning nonetheless.
Shula's is the creation of legendary Miami  Dolphins head coach Don Shula. You might think  
that a football coach knows a thing or two about  filling up hungry people who love to eat — and  
you'd be right. While this steakhouse offers a  fine dining experience, the portions are large,  
and the steaks are worth the money you'll  spend. If you go to Shula's with a big appetite,  
order the 48-ounce Porterhouse, and there's  no way you'll leave without feeling stuffed.
What holds this steakhouse back is the  lack of quality options on the menu.  
While the steaks are really  good, the seafood is mediocre,  
the appetizers are a letdown, and even  the cocktails manage to underwhelm.
If you like your steak to be bleeding,  Stoney River is the place to go.  
In fact, Stoney River doesn't recommend  ordering their steak medium well or above.  
While this may be disappointing for those  who prefer to see no pink in their steak,  
it's a godsend for those who daydream  about digging into a rare slab of meat.
Stoney River has more than a dozen locations  spread across Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,  
Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, and  Tennessee, but it's worth a trip if you can gather  
up a group of like-minded carnivores who enjoy  rare meat. Don't go here if you want to order  
seafood or salads, as you'll be disappointed.  Stick to what Stoney River does best.
Texas Roadhouse is what would happen  if Outback Steakhouse traded in its  
Australian theme for Texas, and actually  prioritized the flavor of its food.  
It even has a better version of Outback's  iconic Bloomin' Onion: the Cactus Blossom.
Texas Roadhouse is definitely a casual  steakhouse with casual steakhouse prices,  
but don't think the laid-back atmosphere  means the steaks will disappoint.  
Far from it. In fact, their steaks are much  better than you might expect considering  
their fairly low prices. The tenderness  of the Dallas Filet is worth the trip,  
and if you want something unique, try the Road  Kill. While the name isn't the most appetizing,  
this steak is covered with jack cheese, mushrooms,  and onions that have been roasted to perfection.
Texas Roadhouse is an especially good  steakhouse option if you're going with a family,  
as the kids menu will satisfy  even the pickiest of eaters.  
With locations in all but one of the 50 states,  you can likely find a Texas Roadhouse near you.
Smith & Wollensky has only seven locations in the  US, so get ready for a drive, because it's a fancy  
steakhouse that isn't afraid to spice things up.  While their standard rib eye isn't spectacular,  
their Cajun Marinated USDA Prime Dry-Aged Bone-In  Rib Eye is definitely worth ordering. This steak  
is very flavorful, but if you don't enjoy  spicy foods, you should probably skip it.
It's a little bit on the pricey  side, but if you are looking for  
something more affordable but equally  as fun, there's always the lunch menu.
Mastro's Restaurants is a marvelous steakhouse  where you need to either go big or go home.  
Don't order the normal steaks on the menu; they're  all above average but not worth writing home  
about. If you're at Mastro's and you have a few  hundred dollars burning a hole in your pocket,  
you owe it to yourself to try one of the Japanese  A5 Wagyu steaks. Sure, you'll spend a whole  
lot of money — but your taste buds will agree  that it is well worth the hit to your wallet.
If you've never eaten A5 Wagyu, you should know  that this is some of the highest quality meat  
on earth. Beware, though, that you might not  be able to go back to regular steak again.
Mastro's Restaurants also have a  lot of seafood options on the menu,  
but you'd be wise to stay away because  these dishes aren't good enough to justify  
the inflated price tag. Make sure you  adhere to their strict dress code, too.
If you want a fine dining steakhouse experience  but don't want to have to break the bank,  
Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak  House is a great place to go.  
Everything about this steakhouse is  fancy, from the decor to the wine list.
While all their steaks are worth ordering at  least once, it's the 45 Day Dry-Aged Prime  
Ribeye that steals the show. It's not cheap, but  this is a steak that is well worth the money.  
The amount of flavor packed into  one slab of meat is over the top.
Even better, you can also order the  seafood from Del Frisco's Double Eagle  
Steak House with confidence. Their salmon and  sea bass dishes are particularly outstanding.
The only issue with this steakhouse is the lack of  
tasty sides. The best side is the Creamed  Spinach with bacon, cheddar cheese, eggs,  
and mushroom. All their other sides,  while fancy, are well below average.
While Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine  Bar is operated by the same company that  
owns Outback Steakhouse, you'd never know it.  The two restaurant chains are worlds apart.
The menu at Fleming's is so thorough that it can  be overwhelming, but you can't really go wrong.  
Be sure to start off with one  of their great appetizers,  
like the Sweet Chili Calamari or the Seared  Pork Belly. And then be sure that you end it  
with a Triple Layer Chocolate Caramel Cake  or any of their other scrumptious desserts.
While other steakhouses offer a wider variety of  steaks, all of Fleming's steaks are really, really  
good. They may be more expensive than more casual  steakhouses, but the quality of their steaks means  
you're actually getting a pretty good deal. Go  with the Filet Mignon if you're having a hard time  
making a choice, especially if you like your steak  medium-rare. It's only six ounces, but delicious.
Of all the casual steakhouse  chains in the country,  
LongHorn Steakhouse reigns  supreme with 600 locations.  
At this restaurant, you get high-end  steakhouse quality at casual steakhouse prices.
The 14-ounce Delmonico is one of the  best steaks you can find anywhere.  
LongHorn Steakhouse expertly trims the  steak, adds its one-of-a-kind seasoning,  
and then grills it over a fire. The result  is stupendous. If you love rare steak,  
go with a rare Delmonico and  your life may be changed forever.
Whether you're coming here for lunch or  dinner, this restaurant has menu options  
that are sure to excite and entice. Of  their appetizers, the Wild West Shrimp  
is fun and tasty. And although many  steakhouses have chocolate lava cakes,  
the Lava Cake at LongHorn Steakhouse is better  than anything the competition can offer.
"What is a Chris Steakhouse? Is  that a type of a f---in' steakhouse?  
What sort of a steakhouse ya  got there? Oh, it's a Chris."
Ruth's Chris Steak House has a well-deserved  reputation for having spectacular food.  
They have the art of serving gloriously  flavorful steaks down to a science.  
If you're looking to impress, Ruth's Chris  Steak House will always get the job done.
Of all the steaks there, the Cowboy Ribeye  is the one that stands apart from the rest  
even if you typically don't like  bone-in steaks. This majestic  
steak is 22 ounces of USDA Prime cut  ribeye that will keep you riveted.
If you are in the mood for some surf and turf,  you can't go wrong with the Petite Filet & Shrimp.  
This Ruth's Chris Steak House specialty comes  with half a dozen large shrimp and a pair of  
ultra-tender medallions. The lobster is  also well worth your hard-earned money.
The Capital Grille is a lot like Ruth's Chris  Steak House, but with a more ambitiously  
robust menu. No matter which meal you select,  you'll walk out of this steakhouse satisfied.
The Porcini-Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye is a mouthful  just to order, but it's well worth the twisting  
of your tongue, popping with a unique flavor that  everyone should taste at least once in their life.  
Their Dry Aged Steaks are some  of the best you will ever eat.
Of any steakhouse on this list, The  Capital Grille also has the best seafood.  
The Seared Salmon melts in your  mouth, while the Lobster Cakes  
will cause you to fantasize about the  next time you'll visit this steakhouse.
The Palm has just under 20 locations, one  of them in an airport, but every location  
is still number one on this list. While it's  nearly impossible to escape this steakhouse  
without spending at least a couple hundred  bucks, splurging at The Palm will never  
leave you feeling an ounce of regret. The food  is so good that it will feel like a bargain.
Of all the steaks there, it's the Filet  Mignon that is the cream of the crop.  
At The Palm, it's the quality of the  meat that makes all the difference.  
Their beef is fed only corn, selected by an  expert to make sure only the best of the best  
makes it into the restaurant, and is aged  at least 35 days. After that long process,  
the result is a steak that blows  all other steaks out of the water.
The Palm also serves outstanding  lamb and perfect seafood,  
and its starters are all very good. Add in an  extensive wine list and exquisite cocktails,  
and this is the place where you'll want to  celebrate all of your life's special moments.
